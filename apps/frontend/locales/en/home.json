  "description": "Game Print Hub is a personal full-stack learning playground — partly built for fun, partly to help me grow as an engineer.\n\nHere I experiment with frontend, backend, infrastructure, DevOps and 3D-printing workflows.\n\nEven though the platform is deployed and actively evolving, it is far from a finished or polished product. Many features are incomplete, some routes are broken, and parts of the system may change significantly from week to week. Game Print Hub is a long-term learning project, not a commercial service.\n\nOver time, as I improve the codebase and architecture, I hope this site will become a fully functional, stable environment that showcases my growth as an engineer.",
